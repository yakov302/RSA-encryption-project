# RSA-encryption-project

An end-to-end implementation of RSA encryption that includes: full implementation of BigInt class with all math and comparison operators, Sieve of Eratosthenes & Millerâ€“Rabin algorithms fot primality test, implementation of Modular exponentiation & Extended Euclidean algorithm, developing algorithm to convert between messages and BigInt and random engine for generate digits.

Application features:
1. Generate random BigInt with a number of bits as you want.
2. Primality test for BigInt.
